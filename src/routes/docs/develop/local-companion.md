# Gitpod Local Companion

**This feature is currently in preview.** Please refer to the [Gitpod Local Companion - localhost is going remote](/blog/local-app) blog post for details on how to use it while we polish a few rough edges and finalize documentation.

## VS Code Desktop Support

If you use VS Code locally, we provide a seamless integration to connect to your Gitpod workspaces. For more details on this, please refer to the [VS Code desktop support docs](/docs/develop/vscode-desktop-support).
