With Gitpod you now have a new editor option for your workspaces: a terminal in the browser.

The terminal in the browser is good for full-time coding with Vim or Emacs, or simply making quick edits. A minimalistic, flexible experience to enhance your productivity using the tools that work best for you.

Customise the browser terminal with your own [dotfiles](/docs/configure/user-settings/dotfiles) or [connect via SSH](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/command-line) for added flexibility.

See [Browser Terminal](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/browser-terminal) for more.
