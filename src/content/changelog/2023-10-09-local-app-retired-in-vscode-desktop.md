Over the past few months we have continued to introduce more stable and reliable methods of connecting to workspaces via SSH. The previously supported method of establishing an SSH connection using the Local Companion app is now retired. No action is required by users, VS Code will automatically switch to the new connection method. For troubleshooting, consult our [guide](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode#troubleshooting).

Please ensure that your Gitpod VS Code Extension, [Remote SSH extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is up-to-date. You can learn more about these connection methods in [connecting to VS Code Desktop](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode#connecting-to-vs-code-desktop).

**Please note:** This deprecation does not apply to the [Local Companion App](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/local-companion).
